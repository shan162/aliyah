            Started as petitions to have a higher educational institution for the 
            youth at the National Government Center area from the community 
            organizations and church groups and negotiations with local officials 
            and other government agencies, the PUP Quezon City Campus is a 
            of concrete success towards the struggle in people’s fight against 
             ignorance. As enshrined on the Deed of Assignment on 24 March 1997,
              that is, “to establish a branch or an extension of PUP at the National
               Government Center with a mandate to bring quality education and subsidized tuition fees to the urban poor communities of 
             Quezon City, with priority given to those from the NGCHP.” Since its establishment in 1997, PUP Quezon City continues to produce 
             quality and globally competitive graduates in the areas of education, information technology, management, marketing, 
             and office management technology. Likewise, true to the University’s mandate as Pamantasan ng Bayan, its graduate degree thru the 
             Open University education system increased by offering two additional programs including the first program 
            offering as practical alternative venue from PUP Main Campus, namely:
